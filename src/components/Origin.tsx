            &quot;While trying to send a file to my friend in the college lab, I
            discovered my desktop&apos;s LAN cable was faulty, leaving me
            without an internet connection. I attempted to use my mobile hotspot
            to email the file, but the login process was a hassle. With no flash
            drive available either, I was unable to transfer it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">
            &quot;I wanted a tool that was as fast as sending a text message but
            as secure as a bank vault. A digital &apos;dead drop&apos; where
            data exists only for the brief moment it&apos;s needed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That&apos;s why I built{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold font-sans">SafeBeam</span>. It&apos;s
            the tool I always wished I had: simple, secure, and respects privacy
            above all else. It solves my problem, and I hope it solves yours
            too!.&quot;
